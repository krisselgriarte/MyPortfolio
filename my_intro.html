        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in The Philippines. I moved here in the US when I was fourteen years old. I am fluent in Tagalog and basic in Spanish. I must say, it was a little tough to learn English because I came here in my pre-teen but I am still proud of myself for accomplishing that. If I can learn how to speak English, I can learn anything and this is how I got into Coding.
        <p>I truly enjoy being on the computer. When I heard about Web Developer, the first thing that came into my mind is that I get to play with websites and create my own. How awesome is that?! I was extremely excited when I finally joined a Bootcamp.
        When I am not at work, I am coding. It's truly addicting.</p>
        <p>Besides being a nerd, I enjoy traveling the world, cooking and practicing yoga.</p>
