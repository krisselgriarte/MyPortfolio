        <p>I was born and raised in The Philippines. I moved here in the US when I was fourteen years old. I am fluent in Tagalog and basic in Spanish. I must say, it was a little tough to learn English because I came here in my pre-teen but I am still proud of myself for accomplishing that. If I can learn how to speak English, I can learn anything and this is how I got into Coding. I truly enjoy being on the computer in general but when I heard about Web Developer, the first thing that came into my mind is that I get to play with websites and create my own. How awesome is that?! I was extremely excited when I finally joined a Bootcamp. When I am not at work, I am coding. It's addicting once you get the language.</p>
