        <h3>The Philippines</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised in Manila. I moved in the United States when I was fourteen which was eleven years ago.
        Yes that makes me fluent in Tagalog. I also know basic Spanish since I am also part Spanish. I have moved six times since I
        came here and enjoyed every bit of it. I do miss my country at times, not only because I get to visit my family but because
        everything is much cheaper and affordable. If you haven't visited The Philippines, you are missing out!

        <h3>Travel the World</h3>
        <p>I truly enjoy traveling. My main goal is to travel each year and learn the culture in other countries. I think
          it's fascinating when I get to experience different food, different people and their beliefs. Traveling thought me
          to be strong, open minded and appreciate what I have.

      <h3>Yoga & Health</h3>
      <p>I love to cook! I like to try different recipes that I normally find online. Sometimes, I create my own
        and learn from scratch. I like to cook my own food because I am big on Health, I want to know what Im putting in
        my body.</p>
      <p>Medatating and Yoga is probably one of my favorite hobby. Yoga definitely outperformed aerobic exercise at improving balance,
        flexibility, strength, pain levels, daily energy level, and it helps with stress. Yoga does more than calm you down
        and make you flexible.
